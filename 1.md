To check linear independence using QR decomposition, perform the decomposition on your matrix and then examine the diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix "R": if any diagonal element of "R" is zero, then the corresponding columns in the original matrix are linearly dependent; if all diagonal elements are non-zero, the columns are linearly independent.
