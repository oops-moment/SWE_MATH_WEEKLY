To check linear independence using QR decomposition, perform the decomposition on your matrix and then examine the diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix "R": if any diagonal element of "R" is zero, then the corresponding columns in the original matrix are linearly dependent; if all diagonal elements are non-zero, the columns are linearly independent.

    """
    Checks if a set of vectors are linearly independent within a given tolerance.

    Parameters:
        vectors (list or np.ndarray): A list or array of vectors.
        tol (float): Tolerance for linear dependence.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the vectors are linearly independent, False otherwise.
